1. Housing Price Prediction

    - Description: 
        - A machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on key features such as house size, number of bedrooms, location, and year built. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using algorithms like Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

- Highlights:

    - Data normalization using MinMaxScaler.
    - Model comparison between Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
    - Visualizations for feature importance and actual vs. predicted prices.
    
2. NumPy Practice

    - Description: 
        - A collection of practice exercises and examples demonstrating the use of NumPy for numerical computations in Python.
- Highlights:

    - Array creation and manipulation.
    - Mathematical operations using NumPy functions.
    - Indexing, slicing, and broadcasting.
    - Matrix operations.
    
3. Pandas Practice

    - Description: 
        - Practice notebooks showcasing data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
- Highlights:

    - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
    - Grouping, aggregations, and filtering.
    - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas.
    - Integration with Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
